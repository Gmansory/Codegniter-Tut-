What is Development Environment

Letâ€™s say we want to have ability to have different development environment for local, development and production. For example, we want to be able to:

Have error reporting turned on local and development environments but turned off on production
Have logging turned on local and development environments but turned off on production
Have different config settings for each of local, development and production environments
Have different database settings for each of local, development and production environments
Have different email settings for each of local, development and production environments


Here is my experience of learning codegniter
